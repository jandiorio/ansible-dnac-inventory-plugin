DNA Center Inventory Plugin allows you to utilize the network discovery
capabilities of Cisco's DNA Center controller as a source of inventory for
Ansible Playbooks.

## Functionality

The DNA Center Inventory plugin will gather all groups (sites) and inventory devices from DNA Center.  The hosts are associated with appropriate sites in the hierarchy.

The following host_vars are associated with the network devices:

- `ansible_connection` : **network_cli** for ios and nxos devices
- `ansible_become_method` : for ios and nxos types. (**enable**)
- `ansible_become` : **yes** for ios and nxos types.
- `ansible_host` : using the `managementIpAddress` from DNA Center - conditionally mapped based on control file `dna_center.yml`.  (*see note at the bottom*)
- `ansible_network_os` : derived from `os` below and required for Ansible network_cli connection plugin
- `os` : network operating system as stored in DNA Center's `softwareType`
- `version` : network operating system version as stored in DNA Center's `softwareVersion`

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to install the Ansible Inventory Plugin for Cisco DNA Center on your Ansible control node.

### Requirements

To utilize the inventory plugin your environment would need to include the following elements:

- Ansible - (tested 2.6.2 and 2.7.2)
- Cisco DNA Center - tested 1.2.8 (cisco recommended version as of 3/26/19)
- Python `requests` module

### Setup

Follow these steps to prepare your environment appropriately to consume the inventory plugin.

**STEP 1.**  Clone or fork this repo

```shell

vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ git clone https://github.com/jandiorio/ansible-dnac-inventory-plugin
Cloning into 'ansible-dnac-inventory-plugin'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 101, done.

```

**STEP 2.** Place the files in the appropriate location or update the environment
variable with the location

```shell
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ cp -r ansible-dnac-inventory-plugin/inventory_plugins dna_3_legacy/
```

**STEP 3.**  Enable the inventory plugin

Most Ansible inventory plugins are disabled by default so the must be enabled
to be used.

The Ansible documentation will explain how to consume inventory plugins.

<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/inventory.html>

`export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_ENABLED=dna_center`

`export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_PLUGINS=$(PWD)`

The alternate way of configuring these options using the `ansible.cfg` file:

1. Add the plugin name to the list of enabled plugins. The order determines the execution order.

    ```ini
    [inventory]
    enable_plugins = host_list, script, yaml, ini, auto, dna_center
    ```

2. Add the path to the inventory_plugins setting in the defaults section. (use a colon : to separate multiple entries)

    ```ini
    [defaults]
    inventory_plugins = /Users/andiorij/development/dnac_inventory_plugin
    ```

<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html>

**STEP 4.**  Update the plugin configuration file `inventory_plugins/dna_center.yml`

```yaml
plugin: dna_center
host: 'dna-3-dnac.campus.wwtatc.local'
validate_certs: false
use_dnac_mgmt_int: false
username: '{{ your_dnac_username }}'
password: '{{ your_dnac_pwd }}'
toplevel:
```

**STEP 5.**  Execute the example below to test functionality

```shell
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~/dna_3_legacy$ ansible-inventory -i inventory_plugins/ --graph

## Observed Issues

The inventory plugin builds the inventory from DNA Center includinig group mappings and some limited host variable mappings seen here:

```json
"dna-3-d2.campus.wwtatc.local": {
                "ansible_become": "yes", 
                "ansible_become_method": "enable", 
                "ansible_connection": "network_cli", 
                "ansible_host": "192.168.19.3",
                "ansible_network_os": "ios", 
                "os": "IOS-XE", 
                "version": "16.9.1"
            }
```

**Issue Observed** - mapping of `ansible_host` is controlled by the plugin control file  `dna_center.yml`.  if this value is mapped, that address will be used for connection.  It must be reachable.  In the lab environment, this was behind a NAT and not reachable directly.  

**Issue Observed** - if `ansible_host` is not mapped, the `inventory_hostname` must be resolvable by the ansible control mode.
